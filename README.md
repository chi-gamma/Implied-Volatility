# Implied-Volatility

The implied volatility of an option contract is the volatility input into a theoretical model, such that the model price matches the market price.
In contrast to historical realized volatility, implied volatility is forward-looking.
The mapping between the option price and black-scholes model implied volatility is a unique one-to-one mapping.
There is no closed-form to determine the implied volatility from an option price hence it is calculated using numerical approximation methods.

The Newtonâ€“Raphson algorithm which is used in this project can return precise results in very few steps if a good initial guess is provided.
I explore two-methods of a good initial guess: The Brenner & Subrahmanyam approximation and the Corrado-Miller approximation.
