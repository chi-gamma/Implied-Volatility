# Implied-Volatility

The implied volatility of an option contract is the forward-looking volatility input into a theoretical model, such that the model price 
matches the market price and this mapping between the option price and implied volatility is a unique one-to-one mapping.
There is no closed-form formula to determine the implied volatility from an option price hence it is calculated using numerical approximation methods.

The Newtonâ€“Raphson algorithm which is used in this project can return precise results in very few steps if a good initial guess is provided.
Given these definitions
S - current price of underlying
K - strike price of option contract
T - time to maturity of option contract
r - risk-free rate
C - price of call option
I explore two-methods of a good initial guess.
The Brenner & Subrahmanyam approximation: 
$$&sigma;=\sqrt{2&pi;\over T} {C-&delta; \over S}$$
where $`&delta;={(S-X)\over 2}`$ and $`X={Ke^{-rT}}`$
